# livo-dev App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
At this point, livo-dev has no user authentication or onboarding screens. There is only a blank repository with a README file. A new visitor typically discovers the project by landing on the GitHub repository page. Since no registration or login system is implemented yet, there are no sign-up methods, no social logins, and no password recovery process. The only way to “get started” today is to clone the repository to a local development environment.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Because the project is still a shell, there is no main application dashboard or home page. Upon cloning and opening the project in an editor, developers see only the README.md file. There is no graphical interface, no sidebar, no navigation menu, and no widgets. The repository root simply contains plan documents, folder placeholders, and configuration files to be added in future development phases.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
Currently, there are no core features implemented in livo-dev. There is no file upload, no profile editor, no payment checkout, and no admin panel. As soon as features are added—for example, a user dashboard or a content management page—the flows will be documented here. At this stage, all feature flows are undefined because the codebase is empty aside from the README. Page transitions have not been created yet and will be mapped once prototypes or UI pages are built.

## Settings and Account Management
Since the project does not yet support user accounts or application settings, there is no settings page, no preferences panel, and no notification configuration. Future work will include adding routes and UI screens for personal information management, password changes, and perhaps subscription or billing sections. Those pages do not exist in the current repository.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
With no front-end or back-end logic in place, there are no error states, no form validation messages, and no connectivity handling. The repository does not yet contain any error pages or fallback screens. Once development of actual features begins, standard error-handling flows and offline states will be designed and documented here.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
At present, livo-dev serves as a project placeholder with a single README file. There is no user journey from sign-up to daily usage because no application components have been built. The intended next steps are to define the application’s purpose, establish authentication flows, create UI pages, and implement the features that will drive a real user journey from onboarding through everyday usage.
