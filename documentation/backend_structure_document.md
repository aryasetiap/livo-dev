# Backend Structure Document for livo-dev

This document outlines a recommended backend structure for the livo-dev project. It uses clear, everyday language so that anyone—regardless of technical background—can grasp how the backend is set up and why each part exists.

## 1. Backend Architecture

**Overall design**
- We start with a monolithic service built on Node.js and Express. This keeps the initial development simple.
- Within the service, we follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:  
  • Models handle data and business rules  
  • Controllers process incoming requests and call model logic  
  • Routes map URLs to controllers

**Scalability and performance**
- Containerize the app with Docker so we can spin up multiple instances easily.  
- Place containers behind a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer) to distribute incoming traffic.  
- Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to handle SSL termination and serve static assets efficiently.

**Maintainability**
- Keep code modular: one folder per feature (e.g., `auth/`, `users/`, `projects/`).  
- Apply linting and a shared style guide (ESLint + Prettier) to keep code consistent.

## 2. Database Management

**Technologies**
- SQL database: PostgreSQL for core data (users, projects, transactions).  
- NoSQL database: MongoDB or a document store for logs, audit trails, or flexible data that doesn’t fit well in tables.

**Data structure and access**
- Use an ORM (e.g., Sequelize or TypeORM) to map JavaScript objects to database tables.  
- For MongoDB, use a driver like Mongoose to define schemas and enforce data shapes.  
- Keep sensitive credentials (database URL, passwords) in environment variables and avoid committing them to source control.

**Data management practices**
- Daily automated backups of PostgreSQL snapshots.  
- Retain backups for at least 30 days.  
- For MongoDB logs, rotate collections monthly to keep storage under control.

## 3. Database Schema

**Human-readable overview**
- **Users** table: Stores user accounts, login credentials (hashed), and roles.  
- **Projects** table: Holds project metadata (title, description, owner, status).  
- **Roles** table: Defines user roles (admin, developer, viewer) and their permissions.  
- **Sessions** table (optional): Tracks active login sessions or issued tokens.

**PostgreSQL schema (example)**
```sql
-- Users and authentication
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  role_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES roles(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User roles and permissions
CREATE TABLE roles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT
);

-- Projects or core records
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  owner_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'draft',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Optional sessions or tokens
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  token VARCHAR(512) NOT NULL,
  issued_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP
);
```  
*Adjust table and column names as the domain evolves.*

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

**Approach**
- Use a RESTful API design. Each resource (user, project) has its own set of routes matching CRUD operations.

**Key endpoints**
- **Authentication**
  • POST `/auth/register`: Create a new user account.  
  • POST `/auth/login`: Verify credentials and return a JWT.  
  • POST `/auth/logout`: Revoke the current session token.

- **Users**
  • GET `/users`: List all users (admin only).  
  • GET `/users/{id}`: Get details of a specific user.  
  • PUT `/users/{id}`: Update user profile or role.  
  • DELETE `/users/{id}`: Disable or remove a user.

- **Projects**
  • GET `/projects`: List projects (with optional filters).  
  • GET `/projects/{id}`: Retrieve a single project.  
  • POST `/projects`: Create a new project.  
  • PUT `/projects/{id}`: Update project details.  
  • DELETE `/projects/{id}`: Archive or delete a project.

**Request/response format**
- Exchange data as JSON.  
- Use standard HTTP status codes: 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

We recommend starting on a managed cloud platform for faster setup and scaling:

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**
  • EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group.  
  • RDS for PostgreSQL (managed database).  
  • S3 for file or asset storage.

- **Alternative**: Heroku or DigitalOcean App Platform for one-click deployments.

Benefits:
- High reliability and global availability zones.  
- Autoscaling handles traffic spikes.  
- Pay-as-you-go pricing keeps costs aligned with usage.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

- **Load Balancer**: Distributes requests across multiple app instances.  
- **Reverse Proxy (Nginx)**: Handles SSL certificates, static files, and rate limits.  
- **Cache (Redis)**: Stores frequently accessed data or session information for faster reads.  
- **CDN (Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront)**: Serves images, scripts, and other static assets close to users worldwide.

How they work together:
1. User request hits the CDN, which caches static assets.  
2. Dynamic requests go to the load balancer.  
3. Load balancer forwards to one of the app servers.  
4. App server checks Redis for cached data before querying the database.  
5. Responses flow back through the same path for a secure, fast experience.

## 7. Security Measures

**Authentication & Authorization**
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication.  
- Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) on protected endpoints.

**Encryption**
- Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all traffic.  
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest in the database (e.g., personal user info).

**Best practices**
- Regular dependency vulnerability scans.  
- Rate limiting and IP throttling to prevent abuse.  
- Input validation and sanitization to guard against SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.  
- Secure headers (Content Security Policy, HSTS) configured in Nginx.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

**Monitoring tools**
- **Application performance**: New Relic or Datadog for end-to-end tracing.  
- **Logs**: Winston (Node.js) shipping logs to an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).  
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana for CPU, memory, database connections.

**Maintenance strategies**
- Automated nightly backups of critical databases.  
- Health checks and alerts on service downtime.  
- Regular dependency updates and scheduled maintenance windows.  
- Automated tests run in a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions, CircleCI) before merging code.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The proposed backend structure for livo-dev combines a familiar Node.js/Express stack with PostgreSQL and Redis to balance simplicity and scalability. By containerizing the service and leveraging managed cloud offerings, the project can grow smoothly from a single development instance to a globally available platform. Security, monitoring, and clear API definitions ensure that both developers and end users will have a reliable, high-performance experience. As livo-dev’s requirements become clearer, this baseline can evolve into microservices or more specialized components without breaking the overall design.
