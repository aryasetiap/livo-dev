# Tech Stack Document for livo-dev

This document explains, in everyday language, the technology choices behind the livo-dev project. Each section describes what we’re using, why we picked it, and how it helps build and run the application smoothly.

## Frontend Technologies

These tools and frameworks shape everything users see and interact with in their browser.

- **Next.js (React framework)**
  - Builds on React to offer server-side rendering (faster first load) and static site generation (better SEO).
  - Reduces setup work by handling routing, code splitting, and build optimizations out of the box.
- **React**
  - A popular library for building user interfaces in a component-based way.
  - Lets us break the UI into reusable pieces, making development faster and code easier to maintain.
- **TypeScript**
  - Adds simple type checks to JavaScript, catching common errors early and improving code clarity.
  - Helps non-technical contributors understand what data each component expects.
- **Tailwind CSS**
  - A utility-first styling framework that provides ready-made CSS classes (e.g., `p-4`, `text-center`).
  - Speeds up design work while keeping styles consistent across the app.
- **Styled Components**
  - Allows writing CSS directly inside component files, scoping styles and avoiding naming collisions.
  - Makes it easy to apply dynamic styles based on component state.
- **React Query (data fetching)**
  - Manages server-state and caching for API calls.
  - Improves user experience by automatically handling loading states, retries, and background updates.
- **Axios**
  - A promise-based HTTP client for sending requests to our backend APIs.
  - Offers simpler syntax than the browser’s built-in `fetch`, plus easy request/response interceptors.

**How these enhance user experience:**
- Faster page loads through server-side rendering and smart bundling.
- Consistent, responsive designs with utility classes.
- Clear code structure that’s easier to update as the app grows.

## Backend Technologies

These technologies handle data storage, business logic, and communication with the frontend.

- **Node.js**
  - Runs JavaScript on the server, so we can share code and language knowledge between frontend and backend.
  - Well-supported ecosystem with thousands of packages.
- **Express.js (or NestJS as an alternative)**
  - Express: a minimal, unopinionated framework for building RESTful APIs.
  - NestJS: a more structured framework (built on Express) that enforces best practices and supports GraphQL out of the box.
- **TypeScript**
  - Brings the same type safety benefits to backend code, reducing runtime errors.
- **PostgreSQL**
  - A reliable, open-source relational database.
  - Handles complex queries and transactions, great for structured data.
- **Prisma ORM**
  - Simplifies database access by generating type-safe queries.
  - Improves developer productivity and reduces risk of SQL mistakes.
- **Redis (optional caching)**
  - Speeds up repeated data fetches by storing frequent queries in memory.
  - Helps reduce load on the primary database.
- **REST API (or GraphQL)**
  - REST: simple, widely known pattern of endpoints (`/users`, `/orders`).
  - GraphQL: more flexible data fetching, allowing clients to request exactly what they need in a single call.

**How these components work together:**
1. Frontend sends HTTP requests (via Axios or GraphQL client).
2. Express/NestJS server processes requests, applies business logic.
3. Server reads/writes data in PostgreSQL (or Redis for cached items) via Prisma.
4. Results are sent back as JSON to the client.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

This section covers where and how the app lives on the internet, plus our workflow tools.

- **Version Control: Git & GitHub**
  - Source code is hosted on GitHub for collaboration and history tracking.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): GitHub Actions**
  - Automatically run tests, linters, and builds on each pull request.
  - Deploys code to staging or production after successful checks.
- **Containerization: Docker**
  - Packages backend services and database definitions into portable containers.
  - Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Hosting Platforms**
  - **Frontend:** Vercel or Netlify for zero-configuration deployments and automatic previews.
  - **Backend & Database:** Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or DigitalOcean App Platform for easy scaling.
- **Infrastructure as Code (optional): Terraform**
  - Defines cloud resources (servers, databases, networks) in code for repeatable setups.
- **Environment Management**
  - `.env` files and secrets stored securely (e.g., GitHub Secrets, AWS Parameter Store).

**How these choices improve reliability and scalability:**
- Automated pipelines catch errors early and speed up releases.
- Containers avoid “works on my machine” problems.
- Cloud platforms let us scale resources up or down based on traffic.

## Third-Party Integrations

These services fill specialized needs without reinventing the wheel.

- **Stripe**
  - Handles payment processing, subscriptions, and invoices securely.
- **SendGrid / Mailgun**
  - Sends transactional emails (welcome messages, password resets).
- **Sentry**
  - Tracks and reports runtime errors in frontend and backend.
  - Provides alerts and stack traces to speed up bug fixes.
- **Google Analytics / Plausible**
  - Monitors user behavior, traffic sources, and page performance.
- **Auth0 / NextAuth**
  - Manages user authentication (login, signup, password reset) with providers like Google or GitHub.

**Benefits of these integrations:**
- Save development time by outsourcing complex, security-sensitive tasks.
- Gain insights into application usage and errors.
- Provide a smoother experience for end users (e.g., one-click social logins).

## Security and Performance Considerations

We build with best practices to protect user data and keep the app snappy.

### Security Measures
- **HTTPS Everywhere**
  - Encrypts data in transit between users and the server.
- **JWT & OAuth2**
  - Secure token-based authentication for APIs.
- **Helmet (Express middleware)**
  - Sets secure HTTP headers (e.g., Content Security Policy).
- **Rate Limiting & CORS**
  - Prevents abuse by limiting repeated requests and controlling cross-origin access.
- **Data Encryption**
  - Encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., passwords) at rest using industry-standard algorithms.
- **Regular Dependency Audits**
  - Use tools like `npm audit` and GitHub Dependabot to catch vulnerabilities.

### Performance Optimizations
- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**
  - Load only the needed JavaScript for each page, reducing initial bundle size.
- **Image Optimizations**
  - Serve appropriately sized and compressed images (Next.js Image component).
- **Server-Side Caching**
  - Cache frequent API responses in Redis or CDN layer.
- **Database Indexing**
  - Add indexes to speed up common queries in PostgreSQL.
- **Browser Caching**
  - Set cache headers for static assets (CSS, JS, images).
