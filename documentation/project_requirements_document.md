# Project Requirements Document

# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for livo-dev Starter Kit

## 1. Project Overview
livo-dev will serve as a fully configured starter kit for any new web or service project. At its core, this repository provides a clear folder structure, essential configuration files, basic sample code, and best-practice documents (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE). By offering a plug-and-play scaffolding, livo-dev removes the guesswork of initial setup and accelerates developer onboarding.

This starter kit is being built because many teams spend repeated time creating the same boilerplate over and over. The key objectives are:

• Deliver a one-click initialization for a new codebase with all standard tooling in place (linting, formatting, CI).  
• Establish clear guidelines and documentation so that both internal and external contributors can start coding without additional hand-holding.  
• Ensure consistency and high quality from day one by embedding best practices (semantic versioning, branching model, code reviews).

Success will be measured by how fast a developer can go from cloning the repo to running the first build or test, and by the absence of setup questions in the issue tracker.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

• Repository folder structure: `src/`, `docs/`, `tests/`, `config/`, `scripts/`.  
• Core documentation files:  
  – README.md (project overview, setup, usage)  
  – CONTRIBUTING.md (how to contribute)  
  – CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (community guidelines)  
  – LICENSE (MIT or chosen license)  
• Configuration files for tooling:  
  – `.gitignore` (ignore common artifacts)  
  – `.editorconfig`, `.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc.json` (code style)  
  – `package.json` (npm scripts, dependencies)  
• Sample code: trivial “Hello, world” endpoint or component under `src/`.  
• Continuous Integration setup (e.g., GitHub Actions workflow) that:  
  – Installs dependencies  
  – Runs linter, formatter check  
  – Executes tests  
• Basic test suite placeholder (unit test example).  
• Version control strategy documentation (branch naming, semantic versioning).  

### Out-of-Scope (Deferred to Later Phases)

• Any business-specific features or actual product logic.  
• Integration with external services (APIs, databases).  
• Deployment scripts or cloud infrastructure code.  
• Advanced testing patterns (load testing, security audits).  
• Localization, theming, or UI component libraries beyond a simple stub.

## 3. User Flow

When a developer visits the livo-dev repository, they begin by reading the **README.md** at the root. This file explains the purpose of the starter kit, lists prerequisites (e.g., Node.js version), and shows a one-line `git clone` command. Next, the developer runs `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to pull in the configured dependencies automatically, then issues `npm run setup` to apply any pre-commit hooks (via Husky) and local configuration.

After setup, the developer can execute `npm test` to verify the sample test passes, `npm run lint` to confirm style rules are enforced, and `npm start` (or equivalent) to spin up the sample “Hello, world” server or component. From here, they open `src/` to add real code, refer to `docs/` for deeper guidelines, and follow CONTRIBUTING.md when ready to submit their first pull request. The CI pipeline on GitHub will run the same checks automatically on each new branch or PR.

## 4. Core Features

• **Scaffolded Folder Structure**: Clear separation of source code, documentation, tests, and configuration.  
• **Comprehensive Documentation**: README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE to guide users and contributors.  
• **Coding Standards and Formatting**: ESLint + Prettier configurations to enforce consistent style.  
• **Version Control Guidelines**: Branch naming conventions and semantic versioning explained in docs.  
• **Sample Code Stub**: Minimal working example (e.g., Express.js “Hello, world” or React component).  
• **Automated Tests**: Basic unit test setup (Jest or similar) with example test file.  
• **Continuous Integration (CI)**: GitHub Actions workflow validating install, linting, testing on each push/pull.  
• **Pre-commit Hooks**: Husky to run linting and tests locally before commits.  

---

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

• **Node.js** (LTS version) with **TypeScript** – for scripting, sample server/component, and type safety.  
• **npm** (or **Yarn**) – package and script management.  
• **ESLint** + **Prettier** – code linting and formatting.  
• **Jest** – unit testing framework.  
• **Husky** – git hooks for pre-commit lint/test.  
• **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD pipeline.  
• **Markdown** – for documentation files.  
• **VSCode** – recommended IDE with workspace settings (optional).  

_No AI models are needed in this starter kit phase._

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

• **Performance**: Initial code clone and build steps should complete in under 2 minutes on a standard developer machine.  
• **Security**: No hard-coded secrets; .gitignore excludes any .env files.  
• **Usability**: Commands documented step by step; clear error messages if prerequisites are missing.  
• **Reliability**: CI pipeline must pass 100% before merging.  
• **Maintainability**: Code and docs organized to allow easy extension or removal of placeholders.

---

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

• Assumes developers have a modern OS with Node.js installed.  
• GitHub Actions is available and enabled on the repository.  
• Users will use Git for version control and follow standard branching workflows.  
• No proprietary or paid services are included in this starter kit.  
• Assumes Internet access for package installation.

---

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

• **Dependency Updates**: Starter kit may drift out of date as new versions of Node, ESLint, Jest are released.  
  • _Mitigation_: Include an annual maintenance task or Dependabot configuration.  
• **CI Rate Limits**: GitHub Actions free tier limits could throttle builds.  
  • _Mitigation_: Batch small commits; consider self-hosted runners if necessary.  
• **Cross-Platform Paths**: Scripts using POSIX paths may fail on Windows.  
  • _Mitigation_: Use cross-platform tools (e.g., `rimraf`) or write scripts in Node.js.  
• **Varying Shells**: Pre-commit hooks may behave differently under PowerShell vs. Bash.  
  • _Mitigation_: Document supported shells and include fallback instructions.

This PRD lays out all foundational elements for the livo-dev starter kit. With these clear requirements, the AI model (or any engineer) can generate subsequent technical documents—frontend guidelines, backend structure, detailed CI config—without any ambiguity.
