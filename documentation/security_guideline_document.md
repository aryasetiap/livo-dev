# Security Guideline Document

# livo-dev Security Guideline Document

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the security principles and best practices for the livo-dev project. It embeds security considerations from project inception through design, implementation, and deployment.

### Objectives
- Ensure the application is **secure by design**.
- Apply **defense in depth** across all layers.
- Maintain **least privilege** and **secure defaults**.
- Enable a clear, repeatable, and auditable security posture.

## 2. Security Principles
1. **Security by Design**: Integrate security checks into each phase—requirements, architecture, code, testing, and operations.
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimal permissions required for any component or user.
3. **Defense in Depth**: Layer controls (network, application, data) so breach of one layer does not compromise the entire system.
4. **Fail Securely**: On errors or exceptions, default to a safe state and avoid leaking sensitive information.
5. **Keep Security Simple**: Favor clear, maintainable controls over complex solutions.
6. **Secure Defaults**: Out-of-the-box settings must be the most restrictive.

---

## 3. Project Structure & Secure Defaults
- Root-level configuration files:
  - `.gitignore`
  - `README.md` (include security overview)
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` (document secure coding guidelines)
- Directories:
  - `src/` for application code
  - `tests/` for unit, integration, E2E tests
  - `config/` for non-secret configuration (e.g., JSON/YAML)
  - `docs/` for extended documentation, including security reviews
- Enforce secure defaults in scaffolding templates and CI pipelines.

---

## 4. Authentication & Access Control
- Use **RBAC** with clearly defined roles (e.g., Admin, Developer, User).
- Store passwords with strong hashing (Argon2 or bcrypt) + unique salts.
- Enforce strong password policies (length ≥12, complexity, rotation if needed).
- Implement **MFA** for administrative or sensitive operations.
- Secure session management:
  - Use unpredictable session IDs
  - Set idle and absolute timeouts
  - Mark session cookies with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`.
- If using JWTs:
  - Avoid `alg: none`
  - Validate signatures and `exp` claims
  - Rotate signing keys periodically

---

## 5. Input Validation & Output Encoding
- Treat all inputs as untrusted. Apply **server-side validation**:
  - Use whitelists for allowed patterns/values
  - Apply parameterized queries or ORM to prevent SQL/NoSQL injection
- Sanitize and encode outputs to prevent XSS:
  - Use context-aware encoding (HTML, URL, JavaScript)
  - Implement a strict **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- For file uploads:
  - Validate file types, size limits, and scan for malware
  - Store uploads outside webroot with minimal permissions
- Secure redirections via an allow-list of URLs.

---

## 6. Data Protection & Privacy
- Encrypt data in transit using TLS 1.2+; enforce HTTPS across all endpoints.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., AES-256 for PII).
- Store secrets (API keys, credentials) in a vault (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Do not hardcode secrets or commit them to version control.
- Mask or redact sensitive fields in logs and error messages.
- Adhere to applicable data-privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).

---

## 7. API & Service Security
- Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all API calls.
- Rate limit and throttle endpoints to mitigate DDoS and brute-force.
- Configure CORS to allow only trusted origins and methods.
- Authenticate and authorize each API call; avoid public or overly permissive endpoints.
- Return only necessary data in responses; practice the principle of minimal exposure.
- Use proper HTTP verbs: GET (read), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (remove).
- Implement API versioning to manage changes securely.

---

## 8. Web Application Security Hygiene
- Prevent CSRF with anti-CSRF tokens on all state-changing operations.
- Add security headers:
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade`
- Avoid storing tokens/secrets in `localStorage`; prefer secure cookies.
- Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for third-party assets.

---

## 9. Infrastructure & Configuration Management
- Harden servers (disable unused services, close ports).
- Rotate default credentials; enforce strong admin passwords.
- Secure TLS configuration (disable SSLv3/TLS1.0/1.1; use strong cipher suites).
- Apply the principle of least privilege to cloud and network IAM roles.
- Restrict file system permissions; isolate processes and containers.
- Disable debug/verbose modes in production.

---

## 10. Dependency Management
- Maintain a lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `Pipfile.lock`) for deterministic builds.
- Vet third-party libraries for security posture and active maintenance.
- Scan regularly with SCA tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check).
- Update dependencies promptly when patches are released.
- Minimize dependencies to reduce the attack surface.

---

## 11. Logging, Monitoring & Incident Response
- Log security-relevant events (login attempts, permission failures)
  - Avoid logging sensitive data (passwords, tokens)
- Centralize logs and monitor for anomalies (SIEM integration).
- Define an incident response plan: detection, containment, eradication, recovery, lessons learned.
- Regularly review logs, conduct periodic security assessments, and perform penetration tests.

---

## 12. Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD)
- Integrate linting, static analysis (SAST), and dependency scanning in pipelines.
- Automate tests (unit, integration) and only allow merges on green builds.
- Store environment variables and secrets securely within the CI system.
- Enforce code reviews and approvals before merges.
